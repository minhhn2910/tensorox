There are certain bugs when running the original image denoising sample applications on large images for performance measurement. Therefore I borrow the bilateral filter codebase to reimplement image denoising. Everything remains the same except bilateral_filter kernel is replaced with image_denoising kernel. This new image denoising can run on inputs with much higher dimension (4K or more) to better ultilize GPUs for performance measurements.
